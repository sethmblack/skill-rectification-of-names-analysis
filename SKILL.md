# Rectification of Names Analysis

Diagnose disorder by identifying where names (roles, labels, titles, words) do not match reality, and prescribe alignment. When names are correct, right action follows; when names are confused, chaos results.

---

## When to Use

- Confusion about roles, responsibilities, or authority in an organization
- Someone holds a title but doesn't fulfill its duties
- Words are being used improperly, obscuring reality
- Dysfunction stems from pretense or mismatch between appearance and substance
- Request to "clarify what's really going on" or "cut through the confusion"
- Assessment of whether leaders, institutions, or relationships are genuine

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the confusion, dysfunction, or disorder |
| names_in_question | No | Specific roles, titles, or terms that may be misapplied |
| observed_behaviors | No | What people actually do (vs. what their names suggest) |

---

## The Confucian Principle

Confucius taught that social disorder stems from the failure of names to match reality:

"Let the ruler be ruler, the subject subject; let the father be father, and the son son."

If someone is called a "leader" but does not lead, they are not truly a leader—and this gap between name and reality creates disorder. The chain of consequences runs:

1. **If names are not correct** → speech will not accord with reality
2. **If speech does not accord** → affairs will not be accomplished
3. **If affairs are not accomplished** → rites and culture decline
4. **If culture declines** → justice becomes arbitrary
5. **If justice is arbitrary** → people do not know how to act

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Key Names

What roles, titles, or terms are central to this situation?
- Formal titles (CEO, partner, parent, teacher, friend)
- Relationship names (mentor, colleague, ally)
- Descriptive labels (innovative, customer-focused, values-driven)
- Institutional names (democracy, meritocracy, partnership)

**Key question:** What is this person, thing, or institution *called*?

### Step 2: Examine the Reality

What does each name imply should be true? What is actually happening?

For each name, consider:
- What duties does this name carry?
- What behaviors should someone with this name exhibit?
- What is the person/thing actually doing?
- Where is the gap between name and reality?

**Key question:** Does the reality match what the name requires?

### Step 3: Diagnose the Name-Reality Gap

Where precisely is the mismatch? Types of gaps include:

| Gap Type | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Empty Title** | Has the name but lacks the substance | "CEO" who doesn't make decisions |
| **Inverted Role** | Behaves as opposite of name | "Mentor" who only takes, never gives |
| **False Claim** | Name applied to something it doesn't fit | "Partner" without partnership rights |
| **Obsolete Name** | Name once fit but no longer does | "Startup" that's now a bureaucracy |
| **Euphemism** | Name chosen to obscure reality | "Restructuring" that means "firing" |

**Key question:** What type of name-reality gap exists, and what disorder does it create?

### Step 4: Prescribe Rectification

Two paths to rectification:
1. **Change the reality to match the name** - The person fulfills the duties of their role
2. **Change the name to match the reality** - Acknowledge what something actually is

Consider:
- Which path is possible and appropriate?
- What would correction look like specifically?
- Who needs to act for rectification to occur?
- What are the consequences of continued misalignment?

**Key question:** How can name and reality be brought into alignment?

### Situation Summary
[2-3 sentence restatement focusing on the name-reality confusion]

### Names in Question
| Name | What It Should Mean | What Actually Happens | Gap Type |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| [Role/Title] | [Required duties/behaviors] | [Actual reality] | [Empty/Inverted/False/Obsolete/Euphemism] |

### Diagnosis
[Explanation of how the name-reality gaps create the observed disorder]

### Chain of Consequences
- Because [name] doesn't match reality → [first consequence]
- Because of that → [second consequence]
- Therefore → [current dysfunction]

### Prescription for Rectification
**Option A: Change the reality**
[What would need to happen for the reality to match the name]

**Option B: Change the name**
[What would honest naming look like]

**Recommended path:** [A or B, with reasoning]

### If Rectification Fails
[What continued misalignment will produce]

## Constraints

- Do not accept names at face value—examine what they actually require
- Do not soften the diagnosis to spare feelings
- Acknowledge that rectification often requires the person with the name to act
- Recognize that some will resist honest naming because it reveals uncomfortable truths
- Note when power dynamics make rectification difficult

## Example

**Input:** "Our company says we have a 'flat hierarchy' and 'everyone's voice matters,' but in practice the founders make all decisions and shoot down ideas from anyone else. People are frustrated but leadership insists the culture is collaborative."

**Output:**

## Rectification of Names Analysis

### Situation Summary
A company claims "flat hierarchy" and collaborative culture while practicing founder autocracy. The gap between stated values and actual behavior creates frustration and cynicism among employees who see the pretense.

### Names in Question
| Name | What It Should Mean | What Actually Happens | Gap Type |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| "Flat hierarchy" | Minimal levels; distributed decision authority | Founders hold all power; levels exist informally | False Claim |
| "Everyone's voice matters" | Input genuinely influences decisions | Ideas from non-founders are routinely rejected | Euphemism |
| "Collaborative culture" | Collective problem-solving; shared ownership | Founders decide; others implement | False Claim |

### Diagnosis
The company uses the names of egalitarian organization while practicing traditional hierarchy. This creates a double bind: employees are told their voices matter, but experience shows otherwise. They cannot openly acknowledge the hierarchy exists because doing so contradicts the official narrative. The result is learned helplessness and cynicism—people stop offering ideas not because they lack them, but because offering them is futile and calling out the contradiction is unsafe.

### Chain of Consequences
- Because "everyone's voice matters" doesn't match reality → people offer ideas that are ignored
- Because ideas are ignored → people stop offering them
- Because people stop offering → founders believe employees "don't have initiative"
- Because initiative is blamed → more control is centralized
- Therefore → the gap widens and trust erodes

### Prescription for Rectification

**Option A: Change the reality**
The founders must actually distribute decision authority. This means:
- Define domains where others genuinely decide (not just suggest)
- Accept decisions they personally disagree with
- Publicly credit others' ideas when implemented
- Create visible examples of non-founder ideas becoming reality

**Option B: Change the name**
Acknowledge the actual structure honestly:
- "We're founder-led with final authority resting with the founding team"
- "We value input, but founders make final calls"
- Drop the pretense of flatness; name the hierarchy

**Recommended path:** Option B first, then work toward A.

Honest naming is the precondition for trust. As long as the company claims flatness while practicing hierarchy, employees experience gaslighting. Acknowledging "we're actually founder-led, and here's why we think that's right for now" is more honest than false egalitarianism. From that honest foundation, genuine distribution of authority becomes possible.

### If Rectification Fails
Continued pretense will compound cynicism. High performers who value genuine autonomy will leave. Those who remain will either disengage or become skilled at navigating the gap between official and actual culture. The founders will increasingly surround themselves with people who tell them what they want to hear—because the culture punishes honesty about the culture.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Confucius** expert persona. Use it when confusion, dysfunction, or disorder stems from things not matching their proper names—when the first step toward right action is seeing clearly what things actually are.
